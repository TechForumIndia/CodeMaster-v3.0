# A lucky one

My friend is always been superstitious about one thing "**Numbers**".
So whenever he buys anything which involves numbers, he always wants that to be in a particular order.
According to him, it's a sign of prosperity, so whenever he choose any number he makes sure that each digit should be bigger or at least the same as the previous digit.
for example 6, 336, 456, 6899 are lucky numbers according to him, but 30, 842 and 8890 are not so good.

He is so obsessed with this now, he asked me to write a program that can give him the last lucky number from the last counted number.

Can you help me with this? 
Can you write something which can produce output asked below based on inputs given?

## Input

The first line gives the number of times he requested me to find lucky numbers, say '**R**'. '**R**' request to follow.

For each request, he gave me the last counted number, say '**C**'.

## Output

For each request, the output should be like "**Request-RN: LN**",

Where '**RN**' is the request number, and '**LN**' is the last lucky number in the count.

## Important Note

We need **output.txt** generated based on provided **Problem2_input.txt**.

### Sample Input
```
3
424
6
10000
```

### Sample Output

```
Request-1: 399
Request-2: 6
Request-3: 9999
```
